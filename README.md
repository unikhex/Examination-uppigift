# *Twenty One Game.*

## *Description*

This is an Examination excerise for Programming 1 at Nackademin. The course is Devops-2023.

The project is about coding a game that likens Black jack but has its own set of tools.

The following are rules we had to follow:

- the user receives one card at a time and after each card, they decide whether they want additional cards or not.

- The goal for the user is to try to get the sum of the card values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding this number.

- Aces can be counted as either 1 or 14.

- If the user exceeds 21, they lose, and the computer wins.

- If the user stops under 21, the computer also draws one card at a time and decides whether to continue or not after each card.

- If the computer gets more than 21 points or fewer points than the user, the user wins; otherwise, the computer wins.

- In other words, the computer wins on a tie as well.

## *Built with these languages*

Python 3.9

## *How it functions*

The code has a class for the deck of cards and has functions that give the player and the dealer their initial cards and add cards if they decide to hit. There is also a function that removes cards that have been given out from the deck. Lastly a function that calculates the values of the dealer's and the player's hand, then ends by decideing who is the winner.

## *To IMprove*

 I could imprive the code currently by having a better ui for the player.

 Also some improvement could be done by adding a visual indicator, for example showing which cards you have instead of showing letters.
